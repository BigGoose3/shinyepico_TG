# ShinyÉPICo

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

ShinyÉPICo is a web interface based on Shiny that makes it easy to do differentially methylated CpGs analysis from Illumina EPIC or 450k DNA methylation arrays. This program allows following a standard pipeline of normalization (with minfi package), model creation and statistical analysis (with limma package), with different options in each step and plots to be able to choose properly. Moreover, you can select different options in the final heatmap and download an RMarkdown report with all the steps chosen.

## System Requirements

ShinyÉPICo can run in GNU/Linux, Windows or macOS. The package dependencies are automatically tried to install when you install the package.

Since the application allows to follow interactively all the analysis process, many objects have to be stored in RAM memory. Therefore, the application can be quite memory demanding, especially when trying to analyze a large number of samples. We recommend at least 16GB of RAM for a smooth use of the application, but depending on the number of samples analyzed and whether they are EPIC or 450k, the needs may be lower or higher. 

## Installation and use

To install ShinyEPICO, you have to use the GitHub repository. It is easy to install it directly in R using the install_github function from the remotes package:


``` r
install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")
install_github("omorante/shinyepico")
```

To run the package:
``` r
library("shinyepico")
run_shinyepico()
```

You can assign the number of cores or the upload memory limit with the arguments of that function. The parallelization of this application does not have a great impact on the RAM memory consumption.
